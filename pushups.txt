Note: should have been easy restarting at week 3. It was not super easy towards the end -- barely could do the last set, with a tiny bit of pausing. Still, it's nice to be able to do a full set without totally dying and failing to do it properly. Something to be said for maxxing ou only at the end, not already at the 3d or 4th set.
